SAMPLE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS (HARDCODED EXAMPLES)
================================================================================

Used in views.py when no AI-generated questions exist:

1. Walk me through how you calculated the magnetic field strength in Q4.
   Hints: What steps did you take? Which formulas did you use? How did you know which approach?

2. If we doubled the current in that wire, what would happen to the magnetic field? Why?
   Hints: What's the underlying principle? What equation governs this? Can you visualize what happens?

3. Explain entropy in your own words and why it always increases in isolated systems.
   Hints: Think about disorder and energy, Consider the second law of thermodynamics

4. How would you use this concept in a practical engineering scenario?
   Hints: Think about practical uses, Consider real-world constraints

5. What was the most challenging part of this homework and why?
   Hints: Reflect on your learning process, What would you do differently next time?

RANDOM SCORE GENERATION LOGIC (REMOVED)
================================================================================

Written Score: random.randint(65, 95)
Interview Score: random.randint(70, 95)
Overall Score: (written_score + interview_score) // 2

Problem Solving: written_score +/- 10%
Conceptual Understanding: written_score +/- 10%
Creative Application: written_score +/- 10%

NOTES
================================================================================

All of the above data has been REMOVED from the production code.

The system now:
- REQUIRES a valid OpenAI API key to function
- Will raise clear errors if API key is missing/invalid
- Only uses real AI-generated content
- No fallback/placeholder data

If you need to test without an API key, you can temporarily restore fallback
logic by copying sections from this file back into:
- core/ai_service.py (_generate_fallback_* methods)
- core/views.py (fallback assignments)
